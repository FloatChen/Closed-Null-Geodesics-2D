Algorithm:

This code implements theoretical results developed by Serra & Haller (2016) [1] at ETH Zurich. 
Specifically, the code developed here can be used to compute closed null-geodesic in 2D flows 
in a fully automated fashion. Examples include elliptic Lagrangian Coherent Structures 
(LCSs) [3], and elliptic Objective Eulerian Coherent Structures (OECSs) [2].
